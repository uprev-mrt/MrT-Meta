# UpRev-MrT

**UpRev** **M**odule **R**eusability and **T**esting

MrT is a collection of reusable modules that can be easily integrated into new projects. Each module is designed and maintained according to guidelines and standards to keep consistency. This allows uniform implementation, documentation and testing.

## Testing

Automated unit testing will be performed using google test. This gives us the ability to output JUnit style test results that can be integrated with Jenkins plugins.

## Abstraction and Reusability
//TODO 

## Guidelines for adding Modules
//TODO get input from software/test team
